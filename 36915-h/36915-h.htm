<P CLASS="poem">
My soul awoke from slumber&mdash;the long ease<BR>
Of years that passed away in dull content,<BR>
Not caring what the world's deep voices meant&mdash;<BR>
Sunk in my dreams, I heard their harmonies<BR>
Like wind-blown clamour of far-calling seas<BR>
That told of Ithaca to sailors spent<BR>
With trouble, and forgetful at the scent<BR>
And taste of fruit plucked from the lotus trees;<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
For as I slept, your footsteps on the grass,<BR>
Your voice, wrought once again the Miracle<BR>
Of Eden; and I saw appear and pass<BR>
Eve in her beauty, binding still the spell<BR>
That Adam felt, when from his opened side<BR>
Stepped Woman forth in loveliness and pride.<BR>

I meet you in the mystery of the night,<BR>
A dear Dream-Goddess on a crescent moon;<BR>
An opalescent splendour, like a noon<BR>
Of lilies; and I wonder that the height<BR>
Should darken for the depth to give me light&mdash;<BR>
Light of your face, so lovely that I swoon<BR>
With gazing, and then wake to find how soon<BR>
Joy of the world fades when you fade from sight.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Beholding you, I am Endymion,<BR>
Lost and immortal in Latmian dreams;<BR>
With Dian bending down to look upon<BR>
Her shepherd, whose æonian slumber seems<BR>
A moment, twinkling like a starry gem<BR>
Among the jewels of her diadem.<BR>

If I could tell why, when you look at me,<BR>
Dreams that have visited half wakeful nights<BR>
Re-form and shape themselves, and Pisgah-sights<BR>
Fill one far valley to a purple sea;<BR>
And white-domed cities rise with porphyry,<BR>
Jacinth and sapphire gates, beneath the heights,<BR>
Rose-flamed within the dawn where Ph&oelig;bus smites<BR>
Earth with his heel&mdash;claiming its lord to be;<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Then would you know what my heart seeks to say<BR>
And falters ere sufficient words be found:<BR>
How all the voiceless night and vocal day<BR>
Love looks on you and trembles into sound;<BR>
Love longs and pleads for his one moment's bliss&mdash;<BR>
You and him mingled in a silent kiss.<BR>

My love is like a spring among the hills<BR>
Whose brimming waters may not be confined,<BR>
But pour one torrent through the ways that wind<BR>
Down to a garden; there the rose distills<BR>
Its nectar; there a tall, white lily fills<BR>
Night with anointing of two lovers, blind,<BR>
Dumb, deaf, of body, spirit, and of mind<BR>
From breathless blending of far-sundered wills.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Long ere my love had reached you, hard I strove<BR>
To send its torrent through the barren fields;<BR>
I wanted you, the lilied treasure-trove<BR>
Of innocence, whose dear possession yields<BR>
Immortal gladness to my heart that knows<BR>
How you surpass the lily and the rose.<BR>

Like one great opal on the breast of Night,<BR>
Soft and translucent, hangs the orb of June!<BR>
I hear wild pipings of a joyous tune<BR>
Played on a golden reed for the delight<BR>
Of you, my hidden, lovely Eremite&mdash;<BR>
You by the fountain from the marble hewn&mdash;<BR>
You silent as in dream, with flowers strewn<BR>
About your feet&mdash;you goddess, robed in white!<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Mute and amazed, I at the broken wall<BR>
Lean fearful, lest the sudden, dreadful dawn<BR>
For me Diana's awful doom let fall;<BR>
And I be cursed with curious Action,<BR>
Save that you find in me this strong defence&mdash;<BR>
My adoration of your innocence.<BR>

When from the rose-mist of creation grew<BR>
God's patient waiting in your wide-set eyes,<BR>
The morning stars, and all the host that flies<BR>
On wings of love, paused at the wondrous blue<BR>
With which the Master, mindful of the hue,<BR>
Stained first the crystal dome of summer skies;<BR>
And afterward the violet that vies<BR>
With amethyst, before He fashioned you.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And I have trembled with those ancient stars;<BR>
My heart has known the flame-winged seraphs' song;<BR>
For no indifferent, dreamy eyelid bars<BR>
Me from the blue, nor veils with lashes long<BR>
Your love, that to my tender gazing grows<BR>
Bold to confess it: I am glad he knows!<BR>

There came three wise men riding from the east;<BR>
One was a king and brought a gift of gold;<BR>
And one bore frankincense that fate foretold;<BR>
While myrrh was offered by a mitred priest.<BR>
Nor ever hath Love's brave adventure ceased<BR>
Since that fair night ashine with stars and cold,<BR>
When even angels paused their wings to fold&mdash;<BR>
Love to adore made one with man and beast.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Accept three gifts I to thee gladly bring;<BR>
Each hath its own divine significance:<BR>
Gold is the Body thou hast crowned a king;<BR>
My Spirit is the prophet's frankincense;<BR>
Myrrh is the Mind which strives to tell thee all<BR>
Love's mystic and melodious ritual!<BR>

Sometimes I think that we have lived before,<BR>
And found sweet interest down the centuries<BR>
In all life's little things that charm and please;<BR>
That we have toiled together at the oar<BR>
In one of Cæsar's galleys; that we bore<BR>
One burden on our backs and bowed the knees<BR>
Of servitude to Charlemagne; and these<BR>
Have taught us how to love for evermore.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Dear Comrade, we have often changed our state;<BR>
We have been slaves and masters, serfs and kings;<BR>
You have been man, I woman, wont to wait<BR>
Upon my lover's word; rememberings<BR>
Are in the mystic rapture that we feel<BR>
Whenever at your feet a while I kneel.<BR>

Two faces haunt the stillnesses of sleep.<BR>
The first is of a woman I have known<BR>
Past years, in many lives, as on a throne<BR>
Within my heart, for whom I daily keep<BR>
Fast and high vigil while deep calls to deep;<BR>
You also stir me, like wind-voices blown<BR>
Through woodland hollows where I walk alone<BR>
When twilight and its shadows slowly creep;<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And I am torn 'twixt love of you and her&mdash;<BR>
My dear Dream-Lady of some long ago&mdash;<BR>
Till past and present, pausing to confer,<BR>
Determine what I hardly dare to know:<BR>
The faces I have loved and love are one&mdash;<BR>
How you have followed me from sun to sun!<BR>

Last night I crossed the spaces to your side,<BR>
As you lay sleeping in the sacred room<BR>
Of our great moment.  Like a lily's bloom,<BR>
Fragile and white were you, my spirit-bride,<BR>
For pain and loneliness with you abide,<BR>
And Death had thought to touch you with his doom,<BR>
Until Love stood angelic at the tomb,<BR>
Drew sword, smote him, and life's door opened wide.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I looked on you and breathed upon your hair&mdash;<BR>
Your hair of such soft, brown, translucent gold!<BR>
Nor did you know that I knelt down in prayer,<BR>
Clasped hands, and worshipped you for the untold<BR>
Magnificence of womanhood divine&mdash;<BR>
God's miracle of Water turned to Wine!<BR>

Paola and Francesca, dead these years,<BR>
And lost forever unto Rimini!<BR>
Lanciotto's garden blooms no more where ye<BR>
Found love is laughter, love is also tears;<BR>
Is peace and pain, high hopes and sudden fears;<BR>
That love is gain and loss, an ecstasy<BR>
Of heaven and then hell's hot eternity;<BR>
A balm that soothes the soul, a flame that sears.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I, too, know of a secret garden where<BR>
Pale asphodels are rivals of the rose;<BR>
And all life's opposites are gathered there<BR>
Before the spirit's agony, that knows<BR>
Gladness ineffable through loving One<BR>
Who hath no equal underneath the sun.<BR>

What has become of our great moment when<BR>
The love we veiled was daringly revealed&mdash;<BR>
You in my arms, O Heart&mdash;and one kiss sealed<BR>
The covenant?  I, who among all men<BR>
Was weakest, gained forthwith the strength of ten;<BR>
And you for my sake instantly repealed<BR>
Your prayer for death, that you might live and yield<BR>
Me title to possess your spirit's ken.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
We may not ever that dear bliss renew;<BR>
But what we found has entered into me&mdash;<BR>
A change of motive and a fairer view,<BR>
As though God whispered: "Henceforth thou shalt be<BR>

Paths and a song in deserts for her sake!"<BR>

What barriers are these that bid me stand<BR>
Baffled, amazed, and wrathful at the sign<BR>
That threatens me for claiming what is mine!<BR>
Have we not walked together hand in hand<BR>
Down lanes of Devon; mused upon the sand<BR>
Beside the Bay of Naples; drunk the wine<BR>
Of famed Fiesole, where Shelley's line<BR>
Thundered of freedom for Italia's land!<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Tradition built this guarded shadow-wall,<BR>
And Shelley's song hath strength to sing it down.<BR>
Come, brave the craven face funereal,<BR>
Of Pharisees who weave of thorns a crown<BR>
For him who has not faltered at the cross,<BR>
But counts that gain which others reckon loss.<BR>

There needs must be misunderstandings, dear;<BR>
For love is more than the much-written word,&mdash;<BR>
Transcends it, as the home-flight of a bird<BR>
Is distanced by the sun.  Let fall the fear;<BR>
Let Joy and constant Certainty appear<BR>
Armed with angelic swords of flame that gird<BR>
Their thighs; for though the day with rain is blurred,<BR>
Hark to the singing legions of the year!<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Always I find gain in lamented loss;<BR>
Some treasure in the beaten path I tread;<BR>
And that alone survives which bears a cross<BR>
Branded by some hot trial that is dead.<BR>

"Love cannot live save love be crucified!"<BR>

Who is to blame that suddenly there fell<BR>
Suspicion like a shadow on our souls?<BR>
Love, who was once supreme, no more controls<BR>
The harmonies.  Hark!  Can you hear the bell<BR>
Across the valley of our tears that swell<BR>
The brook called Cedron?  'Tis a flood that rolls<BR>
Between us; while Doubt in his tower tolls<BR>
Love's loss in our dear, shattered miracle.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Was it a word that somehow clouded thought?<BR>
Was it a flaw in substance of myself<BR>
That proved two tendencies within me wrought&mdash;<BR>
Plantagenet commingled with the Guelph?<BR>

How God blends His base metals with the gold.<BR>

All night my soul groped blindly in a dream<BR>
Through mazes of a mighty corridor,<BR>
Pillared between the stars; and my heart bore<BR>
Its youthful sorrow, calling for the gleam<BR>
Shed from your golden body like a beam<BR>
Sent from the sun&mdash;a beauty nevermore<BR>
Mine to behold, to have, to cherish, for<BR>
Faith's rule was ended and Doubt stood supreme!<BR>

All night my soul groped blindly till the dawn<BR>
Woke on the world with matin song of birds<BR>

Last night&mdash;or was it in the golden morn&mdash;<BR>
Once more I dreamed that I alone did fare<BR>
Forth into spirit-silences; and there<BR>
I found you not; my star was set!  Forlorn,<BR>
I sought the kindred company of worn<BR>
And stricken souls&mdash;lost, sundered souls, who bear<BR>
Old and avoided crosses with each care<BR>
Woven together in their crowns of thorn.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Gods of the patient, vain endeavour, these<BR>

Save that in loving you my soul still soared.<BR>

When singing first my smitten heart's lament,<BR>
My thought was only turned upon my pain,<BR>
And I was also querulous with Cain,<BR>
Crying: "This thing that thou on me hast sent<BR>

Peace, and a quiet joy close the refrain<BR>
Of passionate protesting with a strain<BR>
Of dulcimers and silver trumpets blent:<BR>

For though my shame be branded on my brow,<BR>
And you in tears have driven me afar<BR>

Life's blossoms; all that has been, and is now,<BR>

Along the cobbled highroad straight and wide,<BR>

Down forest-aisles; that altar fires<BR>
Burn in the sunset on the hills,<BR>
And from the pine-wood's ancient spires<BR>
The varied chime of evening fills<BR>
All hearts with rapture; for the light<BR>
Lost on white lilies, and the blue<BR>
Of heaven wasted, the dear night<BR>
With her gold stars and silver dew<BR>
Neglected.  Oh, for what we fail<BR>
To find from life so rich and fair&mdash;<BR>
The rain, the snow, the sleet, the hail,<BR>
Summer, and blossom-breathing air;<BR>
For every useless sorrow,<BR>
And fears for the to-morrow,<BR>
Not knowing Thee, great Deity:<BR>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
